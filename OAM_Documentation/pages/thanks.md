# <i class="fa fa-gift"></i> Thanks

Those companies help us to develop JHipster

*   [Ippon Technologies](http://www.ippon.fr/), which provides time and hardware to [@juliendubois](https://twitter.com/juliendubois) so he can improve the project
*   JetBrains, which provides us free licences for the incredible [IntelliJ IDEA, ultimate edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea). A true hipster would never code with Eclipse :-)
*   [npmsearch](http://npmsearch.com/) which provides the search engine used for our marketplace
*   Pivotal, which gives us free credits on their [Pivotal Web Services](http://run.pivotal.io/) cloud
*   [ElephantSQL](http://www.elephantsql.com/), which gives us several of their "Pretty Panda" Postgresql databases
*   YourKit, LLC, which gives us free licences for the [YourKit Java profiler](http://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/index.jsp)
*   EJ Technologies, which gives us free licences for the [JProfiler Java profiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)

And a very special thanks to the development team from [Galeries Lafayette](http://www.galerieslafayette.com/), which had the original idea of making Grunt work with Ant, and create a modern Web front-end on top of a more classical Spring MVC application.
